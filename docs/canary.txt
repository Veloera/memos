Our intentions are:

- To build a self-hostable, open-source, and community-friendly AI API gateway;
- To provide practical features instead of commercial gimmicks;
- To truly enable “unrestricted” use under an open-source license;
- To prioritize real user needs over trend-driven features;
- To always keep the source code open for self-hosting and auditability;
- To reject all forms of vendor lock-in;
- To maintain clear documentation, rich examples, and a good developer experience;

The following behaviors will be seen as signs of the canary’s death:

- Any implicit control or restriction over user data or behavior;
- Adding tracking code, telemetry, analytics, or any data collection without explicit user consent;
- Introducing unnecessary registration, login, rate-limiting, censorship, or other “platformized” mechanisms;
- Incorporating closed-source components, or requiring registration/authorization for core features;
- Prioritizing commercial features over open-source quality maintenance;
- Delaying security disclosures or downplaying their impact;
- Ignoring compatibility issues or prioritizing them for commercial services;
- Sacrificing neutrality to serve specific vendors;
- Making community discussions, documentation, and releases closed, slow, or non-transparent;
- Neglecting or dismissing community issues;
- Gradually centralizing decision-making within a closed company or organization;
- Making project decisions based on vague, non-technical reasons;

Commitment Mechanism:

- This document must not be changed without broad community consensus;
- Maintainers must publicly explain any controversial actions that violate this document;
- If any of the above “canary death” signs occur, everyone is welcome to fork the project or launch a “guardian branch”;
- We believe that ideals can be inherited—not just code;
- If any of the above rules are violated, it must be recorded in a public log and this Canary Document must be updated;

This document is a declaration of ideological bottom lines, not a legal document. If you see Veloera stray from these principles, please speak up.
